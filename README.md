## Details 
[Odin Project HTML Forms](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/html-forms)
The latest iteration of the project can be [viewed at]( https://ryanameri.github.io/odin-project-html-forms/index.html) 

## Learnings
* Inserting small icons by base64 encoding directly in CSS that can be used as element backgrounds 
* CSS Tooltips using span to position next to the div
* Styling custom checkbox with CSS
* Showing and hiding divs in JS
* Input validation using regex
* Made everything pretty responsive using CSS Grid and some media query breakpoints. Looks good on everything other than the iPhone 5. 

## Major Refreshers
* CSS Grid
* CSS Animations
* CSS Box shadow


## Further Improvements
* Make the sign in button (at the top) responsive similar to original page
* make divs hiding and showing less jerky, perhaps use some animations or another method of hiding elements
* Implement more accessibility in forms, especially in messages. Look up ARIA guidelines. 
* The CSS in JS functions could use a lot of refactoring to get rid of redundant code. There is a lot of repetition in there. 
* The phone number entry should be more responsive to going back and changing, similar to password field. 
* Make tooltips and logo animations more responsive on mobiles
